          <p>
            As Principal of Mooltripakdee International School, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our school
            website and we thank you for taking the time to visit. We hope to provide you with some useful
            information about our school and to give you an insight into the wealth of experiences we offer our
            students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mooltripakdee International School (MIS) opened its doors to students on 25th August 2010. The school was
            built and designed by Ms Wiravan Mooltripakdee (Ms Wee). Her vision was to build on the success of our
            then sister school - MCCI, a Montessori school, located at Naklua Soi 16 - by offering primary school
            education in addition to Preschool and kindergarten. In July 2011, after twenty-two years operating as a
            school, MCCI had to close due to the lease on the land expiring. MCCI teachers and the remaining students
            amalgamated with MIS in August 2011. Offering a broadest range of practical and academic subjects under
            the National Curriculum for England, we endeavour to provide each student with a school that challenges
            and inspires them to reach their individual potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at MIS, the student is not only critically important in the context of everything that goes on in
            the school: in our school, it is our aim that they actually know that they are important, that they feel
            valued and respected and leave here happy every evening. They are allowed to grow and mature in a safe,
            creative and holistic environment that is constantly changing to meet their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am immensely proud of and impressed by the professionalism, commitment, dedication and teamwork of our
            staff to ensure an excellent education for all our students in a caring and supportive environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently introduced structures such as our school-wide ESL program, a developing SEN program, GL
            assessment academic monitoring, in conjunction with an already well-established testing system enables us
            to promote an environment where the emotional, behavioural and educational needs of our students can be
            supported in a positive and reassuring way.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide an extensive range of extra-curricular activities to suit all tastes and interests, from the
            areas of Sports, Theatre, Music, Art, Field Trips, Performance events, Math and Spelling competitions,
            Yoga and Dance to mention but a few. Wholesome participation is encouraged to ensure the well-being and
            happiness of each and every student in our school.
          </p>
          <p>
            MIS is inclusive in every sense of the word, the cultural, sporting, academic and other successes of all
            of our students and staff are proudly celebrated together. Our students have a very strong sense of pride
            in our school, which is demonstrated in their respectful and courteous behaviour towards others, both in
            school and outside and their willingness to advance and promote our school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our school is a vibrant center for academics, sports, and arts in our community, and I would like to
            acknowledge and thank all the people who make our school a hub of learning – Our students, parents and
            families, Thai and Foreign teachers and assistants, our support staff, and our owner, Ms. Wee for their
            continued support of the school. Together we will continue building a strong tradition of excellent
            education at Mooltripakdee International School.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope you enjoy your visit to the website and should you wish to contact us, please find details on the

          <a name="teachers"></a>

          <h2>General School Information</h2>
          <h4>Uniform</h4>
          <p>The School Policy on School uniform is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday & Friday:</strong>&nbsp;School uniform must be worn.</li>
            <li><strong>Thursday:</strong>&nbsp; Children can wear clothes of their own choosing, or if they prefer,
              Traditional Thai clothing or some other International Costume.</li>
            <li><strong>Sports uniform:</strong>&nbsp;Depending on the class time-table.</li>
            <li><strong>Hair and Accessories:</strong>&nbsp;Long hair needs to be tied up at all times and accessories
              need to be in School colours: black, white or green.</li>
            <li><strong>Shoes:</strong>&nbsp;Closed shoes are to be worn at all times for protection. Black shoes are
              preferred.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Hat Policy</h4>
          <p>Children are expected to wear hats for all outdoor activities, especially during break and lunch-time.
            Since
            exposure to the sun can cause sunstroke and a feeling of sleepiness, wearing a hat when outside is very
            important. This is a policy that is adopted by most other International Schools in Thailand. Secondary
            School
            students are not required to wear hats during sporting activities.</p>
          <h4>Back Packs</h4>
          <p>Please ensure your child has a back pack, and the he/she brings it to school each day. Back packs help us
            organise the child's clothing and other items such as: toothbrush/toothpaste, swimming gear, towels, memos
            and notes that we will be sending home on a regular basis. Please check the contents of your child's back
            pack daily.</p>
          <h4>Collection of Children from School</h4>
          <p>Please inform use if anyone different is collecting your child from school. We will ensure that all staff
            are aware of this. Also. please pick up your child on time, as we have no babysitters or child minders to
            care for the children after hours.</p>
          <h4>Sickness or Accident at School</h4>
          <p>If your child becomes unwell at school and is upset or not able to cope with lessons, we will contact you
            and ask you to come and collect him/her. Children are best kept at home until they are quite well enough to
            return to school. To avoid the spread of illness, please keep your child at home at least 48 hours
            following
            sickness and diarrhea. If your child has an infectious or contagious diseases it is important that the
            school
            is informed and a doctor’s clearance obtained before returning to school.</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <em><strong>It is essential that we have your up-to-date home/mobile telephone number
                and also an emergency contact number where we can reach a family member quickly.</strong></em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>We will inform you if your child has had more than a bump or scrape at school. Small children do have a
            tendency to have accidents in school and if this results in your child requiring hospital treatment, we
            will not hesitate to inform you and seek proper care for your child. We will consult your child’s
            individual emergency information, and you will be contacted. If necessary, your child may be taken to the
            hospital indicated on the emergency sheet, and you will be expected to meet us there. The <strong>Parental
              Consent Form</strong> will accompany your child so that immediate treatment may be given. It is very
            important that you keep these details up to date. The closest hospital to our school is the <strong>Bangkok
              Pattaya Hospital</strong>. The contribution of the school is the maximum amount of <strong>&#3647;10,000</strong>
            per visit.</p>
          <h4>School Meals</h4>
          <p>School Meals are served in the dining room under the supervision of teaching assistants. We serve a
            variety of hot food daily. Hot school meals are changed on a termly basis (see <a href="/admissions/#fees">fees</a>).</p>
          <h4>Packed Lunches</h4>
          <p>If your child does not participate in our paid school lunch program, then lunches should be sent to school
            in a suitable strong container with your child’s name and class clearly marked on the front. Please
            consider a cooling device inside, like a frozen drink and/or a cool box to protect your child’s food from
            heat.</p>
          <h4>Snack Time During Break</h4>
